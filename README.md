The project is creation of an address book application using FastAPI that performs the following tasks:

Create, update, and delete addresses:

Addresses should contain coordinates.
Addresses should be saved in an SQLite database.
Addresses should be validated.
Retrieve addresses within a given distance and location coordinates.

No GUI is required so the built-in FastAPIâ€™s Swagger Doc is sufficient.

To run the project please follow below steps:
1. Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. Run the application with uvicorn main:app --reload.
3. Access the API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
